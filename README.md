# pititOS

A very basic OS for self-learning purposes.

## Installation

Bochs and Nasm are required to install and run PitiOS.

```
apt-get install bochs nasm
```

## Make and run

```
make
```

Code is compiled, virtual floppy disk is written 
and Bochs is started automatically. At this moment,
PitiOS should be speaking.
