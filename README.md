# pititOS

A very basic OS for self-learning purposes.

## Installation

Bochs and Nasm are required to install and run PititOS.

```
apt-get install bochs nasm
```

## Make and run

```
make
```

Code is compiled, virtual floppy disk is written 
and Bochs is started automatically. At this moment,
PititOS should be speaking.

about OS development from scratch
 * http://www.gladir.com/CODER/ASM8086/index.htm - a very good reference for 80x86
instructions and BIOS interrupts
